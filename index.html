            <h3>Workers' Compensation</h3>
            <p>Workers' compensation is a system designed to provide financial and medical benefits to employees who are
              injured or become ill as a result of their job. It ensures that workers receive the care and support they
              need while protecting employers from lawsuits related to workplace injuries, helping maintain a safer and
              more accountable work environment.

            <h3>Personal Injury</h3>
            <p>Personal injury law helps individuals who have been harmed due to the negligence or wrongdoing of others.
              It allows victims to seek compensation for medical expenses, lost wages, pain and suffering, and other
              damages, ensuring they have the support needed to recover and hold responsible parties accountable.<br>

            <h3>Defense of the Uninsured Employer</h3>
            <p>This area of law focuses on representing employers who face claims or disputes without having workers'
              compensation insurance. Legal defense helps navigate complex regulations, limit liability, and protect the
              employer’s rights while ensuring compliance with state and federal requirements.
